The TEXT\_TOKENIZE PL/SQL package is a comprehensive utility for **string manipulation, specifically focusing on splitting (tokenizing) strings based on various delimiters, including handling nested groups like parentheses.** It provides functions to parse, consolidate, and retrieve elements from complex text strings, making it invaluable for scenarios where structured data is embedded within unstructured text.

### **What it Does:**

The package defines and manipulates various collection types for delimiters and tokens and offers a rich set of functions for string processing:

1. **Delimiter Management:**  
   * DelimiterSet: A PL/SQL collection (table of VARCHAR2) to hold multiple delimiters.  
   * addDelimiterToSet(p\_delim\_set IN OUT DelimiterSet, p\_delimiter VARCHAR2): Adds a single delimiter to a DelimiterSet.  
   * getDelimiterSetString(p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet): Returns a concatenated string of all delimiters in a DelimiterSet.  
2. **Delimiter Trimming and Consolidation:**  
   * trimDelimiter(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_delim\_string VARCHAR2): Removes specified delimiters from the beginning and end of a string.  
   * consolidateDelimiters(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet, p\_common\_delimiter VARCHAR2): Replaces multiple occurrences of delimiters from a DelimiterSet with a single p\_common\_delimiter. This is crucial for simplifying strings before tokenization.  
3. **Basic String Element Retrieval (No Grouping):**  
   * getElementCount(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_delimiter VARCHAR2): Counts the number of elements in a string separated by a single delimiter.  
   * getStringElement(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_element\_pos NUMBER, p\_delimiter VARCHAR2): Retrieves a specific element from a string based on its position and a single delimiter.  
   * getTokenSet(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_delimiter VARCHAR2): Returns a TokenSet (table of VARCHAR2) containing all elements from a string, split by a single delimiter.  
4. **Advanced String Element Retrieval (Multi-Delimiter and Grouping Support):**  
   * getElementCountMD(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet): Counts elements using a DelimiterSet (multiple delimiters).  
   * getStringElementMD(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_element\_pos NUMBER, p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet): Retrieves a specific element using a DelimiterSet.  
   * getTokenSetMD(p\_string VARCHAR2/CLOB, p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet): Returns a TokenSet using a DelimiterSet.  
   * **Group-Aware Functions (using GrpMD suffix):** These are the most sophisticated functions, designed to handle nested groups (like parentheses, ( and )) where delimiters inside groups should be ignored.  
     * getElementCountGrpMD(p\_string CLOB, p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet, p\_open\_grp VARCHAR2, p\_close\_grp VARCHAR2): Counts elements while respecting grouping characters.  
     * getStringElementGrpMD(p\_string CLOB, p\_element\_pos NUMBER, p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet, p\_open\_grp VARCHAR2, p\_close\_grp VARCHAR2): Retrieves elements from grouped strings.  
     * getTokenSetGrpMD(p\_string CLOB, p\_delim\_set DelimiterSet, p\_open\_grp VARCHAR2, p\_close\_grp VARCHAR2): Returns a TokenSet while respecting grouping characters.  
5. **Pipelined Functions:**  
   * PIPELINE\_VARCHAR2\_TYPE and PIPELINE\_VARCHAR2\_SET: Custom object and collection types defined to support pipelined table functions.  
   * pipeLineTokenSet(p\_set TokenSet): A pipelined function that takes a TokenSet (a PL/SQL collection) and returns its elements as a SQL table-like structure, making it callable directly from SQL queries (e.g., SELECT \* FROM TABLE(TEXT\_TOKENIZE.pipeLineTokenSet(my\_token\_set))).

### **How it Works:**

The core logic for parsing and tokenizing, especially the group-aware functions, likely involves:

* **Iterative Scanning:** Functions typically loop through the input string character by character.  
* **Delimiter Checks:** At each character, it checks if it's a delimiter from the DelimiterSet.  
* **Group Counter:** For grouped parsing, a counter (v\_open\_grp\_cnt and v\_close\_grp\_cnt or similar logic) is maintained. When an opening group character is encountered, the counter increases; for a closing character, it decreases. A delimiter is only considered effective if the group counter is zero (i.e., outside any nested groups).  
* **Substring Extraction:** Once a delimiter (or end of string) is found outside a group, the substring representing the element is extracted.  
* **CLOB Handling:** Overloaded functions handle CLOB data types for large strings, performing operations in chunks if necessary.  
* **Consolidation:** The consolidateDelimiters functions work by finding occurrences of any delimiter from the set and replacing them with a single, predefined consolidation delimiter (e.g., NCHR(254)). This simplifies the string into a single-delimiter-separated format, which can then be easily split.

### **Level of Complexity:**

This package is of **high complexity**. The handling of multiple delimiters, the logic for ignoring delimiters within nested groups, and the efficient processing of potentially large CLOB strings requires sophisticated string manipulation algorithms and careful attention to detail. The use of pipelined functions further adds to its advanced nature.

### **Possible Uses:**

This package is incredibly useful for a wide range of data parsing and integration scenarios:

* **Parsing Delimited Files/Strings:** Ideal for processing data where values are separated by various characters (e.g., CSV, but with more flexibility for complex formats).  
* **Extracting Data from Free-Text Fields:** If structured information is embedded in a less structured text field, this package can help extract specific components. For example, parsing log files, configuration strings, or user-input commands.  
* **Parsing Parameter Strings:** Exactly as seen in DYN\_TABLE\_API, where parameters are often passed as delimited strings (e.g., 'param1:value1,param2:value2'). This package can break down such strings.  
* **Consolidating User Input:** Cleaning up inconsistent delimiters from user-provided text before further processing or storage.  
* **Handling SQL/Code Snippets:** Potentially useful for rudimentary parsing of SQL queries or code snippets where certain keywords or elements need to be extracted, and parentheses/quotes might indicate ignored sections.  
* **Building Custom Query Parsers:** As a foundational component for more complex custom query or rule parsers.  
* **Integration with Other PL/SQL Applications:** As a reusable utility library, as demonstrated by its use in replicateRows and DYN\_TABLE\_API.  
* **Reporting and Analytics:** Transforming raw text data into a more structured format for analysis or reporting, especially when combined with pipelined functions that allow direct SQL querying of tokenized data.

In summary, TEXT\_TOKENIZE is a robust and highly functional PL/SQL library for complex string parsing, offering capabilities beyond standard SUBSTR/INSTR functions, particularly with its support for multiple delimiters and nested grouping.
